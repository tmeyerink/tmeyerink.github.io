<p>When I was in my senior year of high school, my business math teacher decided to have us do the lessons for ruby on Code Academy. At the beginning of these lessons no one in the class really knew how to do any of those lessons. As we moved further into the lessons, I found myself really enjoying it, and I helped some of the other kids in the class understand the language. I kept up with some of the other lessons on Code Academy like, HTML and re-doing the ruby lessons to keep them fresh in my mind in the few years I took off after high school. </p>
<p>About two years after I graduated, I started working at this grocery store as a personal shopper for a new online grocery shopping program. As my coworkers and I were testing out this new app and website for this program, we ran into a lot of bugs. Keep in mind, I’m just a simple little personal shopper for this program yet, I knew nothing of the inner-workings of this program. Whenever we ran into an issue, we’d have to send it off to the developers. And as more and more of these issues arose, I began to wonder, *“hey wouldn’t it be nice if you could help fix some of these issues yourself?”* </p>
<p>I kept up with those lessons, and other free coding websites those years after high school. As I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do, I explored my options. A four year university or college would be too expensive for me at the moment. However, one day I heard one of my relatives mention a coding bootcamp that is seemingly much less expensive. I do want to get a degree eventually in my life, but I think that this bootcamp is a wonderful stepping stone to start me on my journey. So here I am, on my way to becoming a web developer/programmer at Flatiron and I couldn’t be more excited.</p>
